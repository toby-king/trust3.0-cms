                <h4>THE TRUST3.0 PRIVACY FIRST MODEL</h4>
                <p>Built on the principles of an open and transparent Internet, and a privacy and trust based framework, utilising decentralized data ownership and sovereign identity, to unlock a cognitive-enabled experience economy.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Drives rapid innovation, driven by universal and open standards and market demand, based on a fair and equitable value exchange.</p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>Ability to leverage big data, AI, computer vision, and sensors, while building trust by giving control back to citizens on how their data is used, when it used, and who it is used by.</p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>Reduces risks of data leaks, as data is more secure, and highly distributed, and therefore much harder to hack at scale.</p>
                <p>---</p>
                <p>Harder to implement, as it requires a complex and robust framework to be implemented in order to ensure that data is handled and shared correctly.</p>
