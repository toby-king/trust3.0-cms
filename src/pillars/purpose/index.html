    <h4>Explanation</h4>
    <p>The purpose for processing of personal data must be known and the individuals whose data you’re processing must be informed. Why do want their data? Why do you need it? When do you need it? What data do you need? And, how is that data being used? It is not enough to simply indicate that personal data will be collected and processed. This is known as the ‘purpose limitation’ principle.</p>
